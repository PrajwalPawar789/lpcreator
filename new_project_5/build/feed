										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese online gaming stocks, including Tencent, NetEase, and Bilibili, experienced a rebound in their share prices after China&#8217;s top gaming regulator stated that it would &#8220;carefully study&#8221; the concerns of stakeholders regarding draft rules aimed at restricting excessive online gaming and spending. The draft guidelines from China’s National Press and Publication Administration, released last Friday, led to a significant drop in the Hong Kong-listed shares of major gaming companies.</p>
<p>NetEase shares surged up to 14% in early trading after having dropped about 25% on Friday. Tencent, which lost over $43 billion in market value during the previous session, climbed almost 4.5% in early trading. Bilibili, a social media site heavily reliant on domestic gaming revenue, saw its shares rise by 2%, recovering from a 10% decline on Friday.</p>
<p>The draft rules propose measures such as prohibiting daily sign-in incentives, banning online games from forcing players into duels, and imposing restrictions on high-value virtual transactions. The National Press and Publication Administration, responsible for controlling the publication of new games, stated that it would carefully consider stakeholders&#8217; concerns, particularly regarding Articles 17 and 18.</p>
<p>While the rebound in share prices alleviated some concerns, analysts believe that the measures may not be sufficient to completely remove the overhang caused by the draft regulation. The gaming industry in China has been facing increased regulatory scrutiny, and the latest rules add to the broader crackdown that started in late 2020. Investors continue to monitor developments in the regulatory landscape and the potential impact on the gaming sector in China.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Enthusiastically Captivated by Technology from its Nascent Stages!</em></p>
<p>Ever heard the saying that we&#8217;re living in the age of convenience? Well, guess what? We totally are!</p>
<p>Do you remember when going to the bank used to be a dreaded task? The long lines, the never-ending forms, and the painful wait for our turn? And who can forget the trouble of searching through a big, dusty dictionary just to find the meaning of one word? But hey, times have changed, haven&#8217;t they? Since everything became digital, we&#8217;ve gotten access to all kinds of conveniences, some of which we hadn&#8217;t even imagined before. Technology enthusiasts, with their passion and dedication to technology, made all of this possible, making our lives easier and less stressful.</p>
<p><strong>Zohdi El-Saadi</strong>, the <strong>Chief Information Officer</strong> at <strong>IKK Group</strong>, is one such visionary. With a career defined by a boundless passion for technology, he has not only witnessed the evolution of digital landscapes but has been an active participant in shaping them.</p>
<p>Zohdi&#8217;s journey began in the early days of personal computing, when IBM PCs and Apple Macintosh devices were in their nascent stages. It was during this time that his fascination with technology was ignited. From the very outset, he was captivated by the world of application coding, design, databases, and the intricate exchange of information between various technologies. What started as a passion soon evolved into an academic pursuit and a thriving professional career.</p>
<p>The allure of technology&#8217;s constant evolution, the challenge of staying at the forefront of innovation, and the prospect of integrating these cutting-edge technologies into daily life and business practices all played pivotal roles in Zohdi&#8217;s journey. For him, the dynamism of the tech world was not a deterrent but a magnetic force drawing him in.</p>
<p>In his current role, Zohdi-El-Saadi is steering the corporate centralized IT department through a digital odyssey. IKK Group, with its diverse portfolio and international presence, requires a visionary and devoted CIO who can harness technology&#8217;s transformative power.</p>
<p><em>Below are the highlights of the interview: </em></p>
<p><strong>The IKK Group&#8217;s History and Vision</strong></p>
<p>The Isam Khairi Kabbani Group, a prominent leader in the Saudi Business and Construction Sector for over five decades, building a remarkable success story and an enduring legacy. With a history spanning back to 1968, this distinguished conglomerate, comprising over 40 companies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the MENA region, has continually evolved and thrived. The founder, Sheikh Isam Alkabbani, embarked on this remarkable journey after a career in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the OPEC organization. In 1969, he made the pivotal move to Jeddah, laying the foundation for the group&#8217;s inaugural company in 1970.</p>
<p>The Founder&#8217;s Philosophy for the Next Generation espouses the principles of vision, transparency, and unwavering hard work as the cornerstones of success, transcending professional boundaries. This philosophy has shaped the group&#8217;s rich history of innovation, consistently delivering top-tier products and solutions that adhere to both local and international quality standards, thereby enhancing the construction industry and beyond. Their reach extends to over 20 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>Under the steadfast guidance of Chairman Mr. Hassan Al Kabbani, the driving force and primary advocate, the centralized IT department was established over 15 years ago. His visionary initiative and unwavering support have ushered in a new era of cutting-edge technology, epitomized by a state-of-the-art modern data center and the delivery of IT services that adhere to international standards, benefiting a workforce of more than 4500 employees and 14000 workers within the group. This significant achievement was further bolstered by the resolute backing of Group CEO Mr. Amr Alkabbani. His continued support and sponsorship, coupled with a commitment to empowerment and the facilitation of automation and cybersecurity solutions, have further solidified the group&#8217;s impressive success story.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges in Managing IT for Jeddah Municipality</strong></p>
<p>Zohdi encountered a formidable challenge in the realm of change management, with the added complexity of quelling resistance to change within the constraints of swift project delivery and stringent timeframes. This challenge was further amplified by the imperative to concurrently initiate numerous projects and deploy an array of new services. The intricacies were compounded by the necessity to collaborate seamlessly with external agencies and stakeholders while ensuring meticulous task synchronization.</p>
<p>To overcome these hurdles, a multifaceted array of techniques and solutions was adeptly employed. Foremost among these was the implementation of comprehensive training and awareness programs, engaging all pertinent stakeholders in each project. This approach aimed to foster a shared comprehension of project objectives and the associated advantages, with a particular focus on enhancing overall productivity through the automation of processes. The ultimate goal was to bring about a positive transformation in the organization&#8217;s human capital, empowering existing staff to elevate their knowledge and capabilities for optimal utilization of novel solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for Effective Team Management</strong></p>
<p>Zohdi emphasized that effective collaboration in any team relies on having the right individuals in the appropriate roles. This fosters collaboration and team spirit and supports personal achievements. Furthermore, selecting capable and qualified partners and technology vendors is crucial. They should be able to align with the team&#8217;s mission and vision, working together as one entity to enhance IT services and successfully deliver projects. Implementing a professional organizational chart for the sub-IT units or departments within the centralized IT department helps segregate authorities and responsibilities. This ensures that the right resources are allocated to each project or task. However, it is essential to maintain highly efficient and fully orchestrated communication and collaboration between these entities at all times. By integrating these subunits and departments, teamwork becomes a natural outcome rather than just a requirement when delivering a specific service or project.</p>
<p><strong>Driving Technology Initiatives</strong></p>
<p>As a CIO, Zohdi&#8217;s primary responsibility is to actively seek and promote ideas and projects that contribute to business growth and facilitate daily operations. Additionally, he occasionally proposes new technologies that may open up new opportunities for existing business units. The organizational chart of their profession-based structure ensures that each unit or sub-department has the necessary resources and autonomy to propose and test new initiatives that address business needs or improve existing processes, in collaboration with business owners. Numerous examples of such initiatives include the implementation of consolidated data dashboards and reports, which provide comprehensive insights into various operational aspects such as sales, inventory, project status, leads, and collection. Furthermore, integrated systems have been introduced to enhance existing processes, such as the ERP cash van sales and warehouse management system. All of these initiatives are carefully tailored to the specific requirements and demands of the business, taking into account both local and global economic factors as well as the latest technological trends.</p>
<p>A major driving force behind these initiatives is the IKK Group&#8217;s vision and mission, which are fully aligned with the ambitious Vision 2030 of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This vision aims to lead the country towards a future of technological advancement, wherein all government processes and communications, whether with individuals or businesses, are fully automated. This necessitates continuous integration projects with the extensive backend infrastructure that governs the entire data and technology systems of the kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring Quality IT Services &amp; Cybersecurity</strong></p>
<p>Zohdi, while discussing the key factors that contribute to successful service delivery and customer service in the IT industry, emphasized the importance of managing, maintaining, and supporting services according to standards and best practices. As an IT services provider for a diverse group of companies, the centralized IT department has implemented the ITIL framework across all offered IT services. This includes service planning, deployment, and support for all users within the group. Users can access a service catalog through an internal web address, and these services are closely monitored for availability and continuity.</p>
<p>Periodic reports are generated to track the status of service level agreements (SLAs) for requests and incidents, as well as surveys and service status reports that help improve and maintain service quality. To further demonstrate their commitment to operational excellence, the department has achieved ISO 20000 accreditation. The IT services management unit conducts regular internal reviews and collaborates with third-party audit firms to ensure compliance controls are maintained and to perform the annual periodic audit process for renewal. In addition, the centralized IT department undergoes a bi-annual third-party cybersecurity audit, covering major information security controls aligned with international standards, and is accredited and certified by Saudi ARAMCO CCC (Cybersecurity Compliance Certifications).</p>
<p><strong>Navigating Challenges in the IT Industry</strong></p>
<p>The IKK Group faces a significant challenge daily, which involves the users&#8217; adaptation to new technologies and the corresponding measurements and risks associated with them. One of the key concerns is the increasing cybersecurity and information security risks that arise every second. The department is dedicated to promoting user awareness and implementing stricter measures for accessing and operating IT services while ensuring that these solutions do not overly complicate users&#8217; daily operations. The department places a strong emphasis on educating and informing all users about new technologies and the associated risks through targeted campaigns, workshops, and public events. To further this effort, an important initiative took place in February 2023, where the department collaborated with local chapters/teams of Microsoft, VEAM, and Palo Alto Networks to organize a unique event in the kingdom. This event, known as CEAK 2023 (Cybersecurity Event for Awareness and Knowledge), brought together internal and external executive invitees to highlight the significance of collaboration among entities in the fields of technology and cybersecurity awareness.</p>
<p><strong>Implementing Technology for Efficiency and Productivity</strong></p>
<p>Zohdi mentioned that the centralized IT department has undertaken numerous initiatives and projects, particularly focused on process automation. The ERP and applications consultants, as well as the support unit and development unit, conduct thorough analysis and design of both existing and new processes. This is done to align enterprise applications or create tailored solutions that enhance overall business operations. Moreover, the department implements system integrations for specific trading and manufacturing business lines within the organization, incorporating vertical and specialized solutions. Additionally, various services are introduced to enhance productivity through the utilization of cloud-based business tools, hosting services, and modern communication solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Facilitating Collaboration </strong></p>
<p>The centralized IT department within the IKK group of companies consists of collaborative sub-departments and units that work together to provide comprehensive IT services and solutions for all companies and departments within the group. The IT customer support department, known as the front-end department, is the main point of contact for all daily technical and IT-related needs across the group. Users are assisted through an automated service desk that offers full visibility into each support ticket. This service desk is closely monitored through automated SLA triggers and reports, along with a unified call center. The IT procurement unit is responsible for managing all IT systems, hardware, and software purchases. They work in close coordination with various finance departments within the group to effectively manage the department&#8217;s budget and financial operations. Their ERP/Applications Consultants Unit provides functional and technical consultation, as well as implementation and support for core business systems and applications used by the group&#8217;s companies in various business lines, such as trading, manufacturing, and specialized contracting. Additionally, their development unit handles all necessary customizations for these applications and develops customized reports and dashboards tailored to each company&#8217;s needs, as well as consolidated reports for the entire group.</p>
<p>The HR/MIS unit supports all internal information systems, including the main HR system, and ensures seamless integration with other internal information systems. The back-end infrastructure and cybersecurity department oversees the operations and management of the group&#8217;s data center hardware and services. They work diligently to configure and secure the required platform for all operations, prioritizing the safety, continuity, and confidentiality of their IT services.</p>
<p>These specialized internal departments and units operate cohesively, much like a well-organized beehive, to ensure the safe and continuous delivery of all IT services with the utmost confidentiality.</p>
<p><strong>Career Advice</strong></p>
<p>Zohdi suggests that a key piece of advice is to focus on self-development to stay up-to-date with beneficial and business-oriented technological trends. By staying informed about new technological innovations, businesses can improve their operations and achieve their objectives more efficiently. As responsibilities and work scope increase, it becomes important to enhance conceptual and emotional skills alongside technical skills to have a broader understanding of the business and its components. Leadership should not be limited to technical team leadership but should also involve being a role model and influencer for the team, helping them discover their talents and utilize them to achieve desired business outcomes. Ultimately, IT serves as a major enabler for any type of business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Innovative Leadership in Technology and Business Transformation!</em></p>
<p>In the contemporary corporate landscape, the integration of technology solutions has become imperative for attaining organizational objectives. These solutions not only enhance consumer experiences but also catalyze innovation, augment operational efficiency, and equip businesses with the agility to promptly adapt to dynamic market conditions. Enterprises adept at leveraging technology are strategically positioned for sustained growth and prosperity in the long run.</p>
<p>In today’s fiercely competitive business environment, the significance of Chief Information Officers (CIOs) has risen to paramount importance. CIOs play a pivotal role in formulating the organization’s technology strategy, adeptly managing IT infrastructure and resources, and fostering technological innovation to drive business objectives. In the prevailing digital age, where technology continues to be a cornerstone of organizational performance, the role of CIOs stands as a critical determinant of success.</p>
<p><strong>Rany M. Sabry</strong>,<strong> CIO</strong> of <strong>Credit Guarantee Company,</strong> is a prominent leader in ICT with more than 25 years of expertise. Throughout his career, he has demonstrated a strong dedication to leveraging technology to improve organizational productivity, profitability, and creativity. Rany is a dynamic leader with experience shaping contemporary business models, leading digital transformations, and</p>
<p>delivering technology-based goods and services in challenging, quickly changing contexts. We had the opportunity to understand his impeccable approach to driving innovation at the CGC.</p>
<p><em>Here are the key highlights from the interview:</em></p>
<p><strong>Could you please tell us about yourself and what motivated you to embark on this sector?</strong></p>
<p>I have over 25 years of experience as a dynamic ICT senior executive leader, helping organizations achieve their business goals with technology solutions that enhance efficiency, profitability, and innovation. I have a proven track record of leading successful digital transformations.</p>
<p>developing modern business models and delivering technology-based products and services in complex environments. I am always driven by a passion for excellence and creativity.</p>
<p>I am passionate about providing creative technologies that can build a sustainable business. I believe that accessing information efficiently is key to improving business intelligence and creativity. I am always eager to learn new skills and technologies that can help me solve problems and create value for my clients.</p>
<p><strong>Could you please brief us about your company and its inception story?</strong></p>
<p>The credit guarantee company in Egypt (CGC Egypt) was established in 1989. The company was founded with the vision of boosting the Egyptian economy by empowering the private sector and providing financial solutions with a special focus on micro, small, and medium enterprises.</p>
<p>(MSMEs). CGC Egypt offers various guarantee products that help MSMEs access finance from different financial institutions (banks and non-banks) that cater to their needs.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see the role of the CIO evolving in today’s rapidly changing technological landscape, and what strategies do you employ to align IT initiatives with the overall business objectives and goals?</strong></p>
<p>The role of the CIO in financial services is undergoing a significant transformation as technology becomes a key driver of competitive advantage and strategic disruption. The CIO is no longer just responsible for managing and maintaining ICT systems but also for leading innovation and change across the organization. The CIO needs to be a shapeshifter, adapting to the evolving needs and expectations of business partners, customers, and regulations.</p>
<p>To align ICT initiatives with the business objectives and goals, I use the following strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaborate closely with business leaders and stakeholders to understand their vision, challenges, and opportunities and to co-create solutions that deliver value and impact.</li>
<li>Foster a culture of agility, experimentation, and learning within the ICT function, enabling rapid prototyping, testing, and scaling of new technologies and capabilities.</li>
<li>Leverage data and analytics to generate insights, optimize processes, and enhance decision-making across the organization.</li>
<li>Invest in developing the skills and capabilities of the ICT team, ensuring they have the technical expertise, business acumen, and customer orientation to deliver on the ICT agenda.</li>
<li>Manage the ICT risks and governance, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and security standards.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do you prioritize and manage IT projects to ensure efficient resource allocation and timely delivery?</strong></p>
<p>I prioritize and manage ICT projects by aligning with the organization’s strategic goals, using a project management framework and agile methodologies, tracking the progress and budget, communicating with stakeholders, resolving issues and risks, complying with standards, and learning</p>
<p>from feedback. The most important thing is to manage the expectations and satisfaction of the stakeholders and ensure that the ICT projects deliver value and meet their needs and requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Can you provide an example of a successful IT project that you led and the impact it had on the organization?</strong></p>
<p>I led an ICT project to implement robotic process automation (RPA) for several repetitive and manual tasks in CGC. The project involved identifying suitable processes for automation. The project had a significant impact on the organization in terms of efficiency, quality, and cost. The RPA bots were able to perform the tasks faster, more accurately, and more consistently than human workers, reducing errors and delays. The project also freed up the human workers from mundane tasks and allowed them to focus on more value-added and creative activities. The project also reduced operational costs by saving time and resources.</p>
<p><strong>What emerging technologies do you believe will have a significant impact on businesses in the near future, and how do you stay updated with the latest trends?</strong></p>
<p>Technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) are expected to have a significant impact. AI can enhance customer satisfaction through predictive analytics, and RPA streamlines repetitive tasks, which will impact productivity.</p>
<p>To stay updated with these trends, we engage in continuous research, attend industry conferences, collaborate with technology experts, and participate in workshops. Moreover, we maintain close relationships with technology vendors to understand advancements and potential applications in the financial domain. This proactive approach enables us to adopt relevant technologies swiftly and efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>How do you foster innovation within your IT department, and what steps do you take to encourage collaboration and creativity among your team members?</strong></p>
<p>I foster innovation within the ICT team by creating a culture of curiosity, experimentation, and learning. I encourage the team members to explore new technologies, tools, and methods that can improve our processes, products, and services. I also provide them with the resources, time, and support they need to pursue their ideas and test their hypotheses.</p>
<p><strong>How do you manage relationships with external vendors and partners, and what criteria do you consider when selecting technology solutions for your organization?</strong></p>
<p>I manage relationships with external vendors and partners by following a structured and collaborative process that involves the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define the scope, objectives, and requirements of the ICT project or initiative.</li>
<li>Conducting market surveys, research, and analysis to identify potential vendors and partners that can offer the best technology solutions for our organization.</li>
<li>Evaluating the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the technology solution, considering implementation, maintenance, and operational costs.</li>
<li>Ensuring the technology can seamlessly integrate with existing systems and future expansions.</li>
<li>Evaluating and comparing the proposals, tenders, and quotations from the shortlisted vendors and partners based on various criteria such as quality, cost, functionality, compatibility, security, scalability, previous experience, etc.</li>
<li>Monitoring and managing the implementation, integration, testing, and deployment of the technology solution with the vendor or partner.</li>
<li>Reviewing and assessing the performance and outcomes of the technology solution with the vendor or partner.</li>
</ul>
<p>When selecting technology solutions for our organization, I consider criteria such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alignment with the vision, mission, values, and goals of CGC as a financial institute.</li>
<li>Compliance with the industry standards, regulations, and best practices in ICT.</li>
<li>Suitability for the current and future needs and expectations of our customers (internal and external) and stakeholders.</li>
<li>Availability of technical support, maintenance, and updates from the vendor or partner.</li>
<li>Ease of use, accessibility, and user-friendliness of the technology solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these strategies, we ensure that our relationships with external vendors and the technologies we select are conducive to CGC’s mission and strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>By &#8211; </em></strong><strong><em>David Vitrano, </em></strong><strong><em>Chief Commercial Officer at Visable</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hamburg, October 2023 &#8211; </strong>The exchange of goods and services across borders—in other words, foreign trade—is becoming increasingly important. All crises of recent years, from the COVID pandemic to the war in Ukraine, scarcity of some resources, or inflation, have shown that geographic sales diversification can be a decisive resilience factor for companies. Especially now that China&#8217;s economy is weakening, companies need replacement markets. Thanks to the opportunities brought about by increasing digitalization, new markets can be conquered more easily. Small and medium-sized companies can advertise and sell their products or services globally via online shops as well as platforms—and in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>Visable is a German-based company operating 2 platforms wlw (Wer Liefert Was) for German-speaking countries and <strong>Europages </strong>for SMEs in other European countries. Internationalization is perceived as a huge opportunity for German SMEs, especially in the B2B sector. B2C trade has long been global, but B2B companies are still lagging behind. Fueled by the developments of recent years, SME B2B business is now catching up in the area of internationalization and is expected to develop rapidly. The online B2B e-commerce market is estimated at 25 billion dollars by 2028, seven times more than the B2C e-commerce market. SMEs can tap this huge worldwide opportunity from their national location.</p>
<p>France, number 8 in total exports worldwide, or even Germany, number 3 in total exports worldwide, according to the <em>Observatory of Economic Complexity </em>(OEC),<em> has</em> by no means exhausted the gigantic potential of digital sales. European SMEs would benefit from the reputation of the &#8220;Made in Europe&#8221;, &#8220;Made in Germany&#8221;, and &#8220;Made in France&#8221; quality seals and the high demand for their products abroad. The opportunities for international expansion for European SMEs are greater than the risks.</p>
<p><strong>Internationalizing Marketing</strong></p>
<p>Suitable marketing measures to support the internationalization of business activities are search engine optimization (SEO), search engine advertising (SEA), and social media. But above all, international online marketplaces are key players. Depending on the source, up to 1 professional purchaser out of 2 is using B2B marketplaces for his or her procurement needs. In Europe, platforms such as Europages and wlw are available. They bring suppliers and buyers together. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The inquiries on Europages come from a total of 193 countries, and on wlw, from 137 countries.</li>
<li>On wlw, the most inquiries in 2022 came from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the United States, and China.</li>
<li>On Europages, the most requests came from France, Spain, the United States, Italy, and Germany.</li>
<li>The 10 countries with the most requests on wlw are distributed across 3 continents: Europe, North America, and Asia.</li>
<li>The 10 countries with the most inquiries on Europages are distributed over the 4 continents: Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Partner of European SMEs: wlw and Europages Help with Internationalization</strong></p>
<p>With helpful functions on its B2B platforms, wlw and Europages, Visable supports European SMEs in their steps onto the global market. A company search and a precise product search with many sorting and filtering options are available for this purpose. Among other things, filtering according to certain quality criteria is possible, such as ISO certifications, which are becoming increasingly relevant in order to prove compliance with prescribed standards with regard to supply chain protection laws. Via the <em>Request for Quote</em>/<em>Connect</em> service, buyers can also commission very specific inquiries, which are processed by the Visable research team and AI-supported.</p>
<p>Already, a large proportion of the messages on Europages are sent across national and language borders. Linguistic hurdles do not stand in the way of initiating business. This is because the platform specifically aims to make it easier for B2B buyers to search for the products or services they need in their own language. When they find a relevant supplier, Europages helps them contact him in their own language. Several companies from different countries with different languages can also be contacted in one inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>Internationalization Made Easy &#8211; With the Right Strategy and the Right Partners</strong></p>
<p>With a well-thought-out strategy, internationalization projects are a huge opportunity for growth for European SMEs &#8211; especially in the B2B sector. They ensure future viability, as there is strong cut-throat competition in the local market. Thanks to the possibilities of digitalization, it is easier than ever to compare and sell products and services worldwide.</p>
<p>Visable supports industrial SMEs in making products and services internationally accessible to buyers. As a combination of its own B2B platforms and online marketing services, such as Google Ads and Retargeting, tailored specifically to business customers, the company offers a broad digital portfolio for increasing reach on the Internet.</p>
<p>The platforms operated by Visable GmbH include wlw (&#8220;Wer liefert was&#8221;), today the leading B2B platform in the D-A-CH region, and the European B2B platform Europages, on which around three million companies are registered. Together, the platforms reach three million B2B buyers a month who are looking for detailed company and product information. With its online marketing services, Visable offers companies additional opportunities to increase their reach on the Internet.</p>
<p>Visable was created in response to the challenges of internationalization and digitalization in the B2B sector and today employs around 450 people at its locations in Hamburg, Berlin, Münster, and Paris. As a joint umbrella for the wlw and Europages brands, Visable is continuously expanding its B2B platforms and online marketing services.</p>

<p>This <em>Trade and Development Report Update</em> warns that developing countries are facing years of difficulty as the global economy slows down amid heightened financial turbulence.</p>
<h4><strong>Key points:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Global growth is expected to be lower than earlier projected, signaling a potential economic downturn.</li>
<li>Developing countries face mounting debt and insufficient international support, risking another lost decade.</li>
<li>The banking crisis highlights long-neglected financial fragilities and regulatory weaknesses.</li>
<li>Declining energy costs lead to lower inflation, but elevated food prices maintain a high cost of living in many developing countries.</li>
<li>Growing global asymmetries threaten developing countries&#8217; resilience, requiring stronger multilateral action and an urgent focus on sovereign debt architecture.</li>

<p>Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are known for their scarcity of available resources, facing challenges beyond predictions, and looking for opportunities to survive and thrive in unpredictable international business environments. However, some SMEs are better equipped to develop opportunities and bring value to the firm than others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A Tale of Determination, Ambition, and Leadership</em></p>
<p>In the world of business, success stories often start with a clear path and a well-defined plan. These stories inspire and motivate aspiring entrepreneurs, showcasing the power of determination and strategic thinking. But what if success doesn&#8217;t always follow a linear path? What if there are unexpected twists and turns that lead to even greater achievements?</p>
<p>For <strong>David Morris</strong>, the journey to the top was a winding road, filled with unexpected twists and turns. From starting as an apprentice electrician to becoming the <strong>CEO </strong>of <strong>CBRE Excellerate</strong>, his story is not just a testament to his resilience but a shining example of how sheer determination and hard work can pave the way to success.</p>
<p>His journey into the real estate sector was not preordained but rather a stroke of luck that transformed into a lifelong passion. Accepted into an apprenticeship program, he embarked on his career as an electrician, working his way up the industry ladder step by step.</p>
<p>His journey, however, was not without its challenges. Unlike many of his peers who held university degrees, David lacked formal qualifications when he left school. This presented a unique obstacle in his path to leadership, as he found himself competing with peers who seemed better suited for the C-suite. Instead of yielding to this adversity, his resolve only grew stronger. He was determined to succeed, and his journey is a testament to the idea that determination and hard work can conquer any obstacle.</p>
<p>In his pursuit of excellence, David decided to further his education by enrolling in an MBA program in his 30s. This dedication to personal growth led to his graduation with an MBA in Strategy and Corporate Governance from Glasgow Caledonian University, enhancing his strategic acumen and leadership capabilities.</p>
<p>As a leader, he is known for his unwavering commitment to his employees. He understands that an organization&#8217;s strength lies in its people, and he is passionate about ensuring that every member of the CBRE Excellerate family feels connected, involved, and motivated. Whether it&#8217;s presenting to his board or addressing his field employees, he takes pride in every aspect of his role.</p>
<p>David&#8217;s career has taken him to various locations around the world, including Europe and Southeast Asia, before settling in South Africa three years ago. He joined CBRE Excellerate for Africa and the Middle East as the COO initially to stabilize the company, and later became the CEO to drive growth. His dedication to the company is a testament to his character, as he has worked at 3 different companies, steadily climbing the ladder, including his current role at CBRE/CBRE Excellerate, where he has devoted 15 years of service.</p>
<p><em>Below are the highlights of the interview:</em></p>
<p><strong>A Journey of Innovation and Success</strong></p>
<p>CBRE Excellerate is renowned for its integrated, high-quality real estate services, specifically designed to meet the unique requirements of diverse markets in Africa and the Middle East. With a strong focus on excellence and innovation, CBRE Excellerate has established itself as a trusted partner for clients in need of exceptional real estate solutions. The company&#8217;s wide range of services includes facilities management, advisory and transaction services, project and development management, broking, valuations, and property management</p>
<p>CBRE Excellerate primarily serves corporate entities through contractual arrangements, extending not only to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa but also globally, depending on the scope of their real estate portfolios. This extensive geographic coverage highlights the company&#8217;s ability to cater to diverse client needs and various market conditions, positioning it as a versatile and adaptable partner in the field of real estate services.</p>
<p>One of CBRE Excellerate&#8217;s core strengths lies in its holistic approach to real estate management. Its integrated facilities management services provide enterprise clients with a comprehensive solution that covers the entire real estate lifecycle. This strategic capability enables CBRE Excellerate to oversee all stages, from asset acquisition to project and development management, and from facilities management to valuations. By offering a consolidated suite of services, the company streamlines processes, enhances efficiency, and maximizes the potential for value creation.</p>
<p>CBRE Excellerate places a strong emphasis on sustainability and responsible business practices, which underpin every aspect of its operations. The company is mindful of its environmental impact and strives to incorporate eco-friendly and sustainable practices into its services whenever possible. This commitment not only aligns with global trends but also demonstrates its responsibility towards the communities and environments in which it operates.</p>
<p><strong>Secrets to Effective Decision-Making</strong></p>
<p>David formulates CBRE Excellerate&#8217;s organizational strategy with an open mind. Firstly, he empowers his senior team, who are subject matter experts in their own right, to provide him with the advice needed to ensure effective and informed decision-making. Secondly, he utilizes a combination of academic experience and practical knowledge to strategize, enabling the business to establish clear and concise objectives for its teams.</p>
<p><strong>The Winning Recipe</strong></p>
<p>During the discussion on the factors that contribute to a company&#8217;s growth and sustainability, David kindly emphasized the value of diversification within the sector of operation. He mentioned that this allows businesses to recognize strategic opportunities in the market and maintain a strong competitive position. Furthermore, he kindly emphasized the importance of remaining true to the company&#8217;s values and having a well-defined path for achieving desired goals.</p>
<p><strong>Powerful Company Culture</strong></p>
<p>According to David, the role of culture in the overall success of an organization cannot be understated. He believes that culture is the bedrock upon which a successful business is built. David warns that in fast-paced and growing organizations, there is a significant risk of diluting the culture. He emphasizes that failing to recognize the impact of culture can have negative consequences for sustainable growth. To cultivate a positive and productive company culture, David stresses the importance of fostering employee engagement. He suggests that providing clear guidance to employees about the organization&#8217;s goals and direction is crucial to ensuring their active participation and dedication to achieving these objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Successful Change Management Strategies</strong></p>
<p>CBRE Excellerate, a joint venture, faced challenges due to the merging of two different management styles. However, careful management and the involvement of all key stakeholders from the beginning ensured engagement and a smooth transition. A project plan that resonated with everyone provided clear direction and fostered a sense of belonging throughout the journey.</p>
<p><strong>Setting Industry Standards for Diversity and Inclusion</strong></p>
<p>Organizations achieve greater success by cultivating a workforce that is diverse and inclusive. CBRE Excellerate, as a company, promotes and embraces these values in all aspects of its operations. “Through initiatives like &#8216;Belonging Beyond Borders&#8217; and the diligent oversight of our DE&amp;I steerco, we strive to meet our predetermined targets and establish ourselves as industry leaders. Our commitment to these principles has been recognized by the Disability Equality Index® (DEI), which has honoured us as the &#8220;Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion&#8221; and awarded us a top score in 2023.”</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Approach to Growth</strong></p>
<p>CBRE Excellerate prioritizes measured and sustainable growth, recognizing the potential risks associated with rapid expansion. The company instills this mindset within its sales teams and maintains regular monitoring to ensure that growth remains in check. With a risk-based approach applied to all operations, CBRE Excellerate also established a dedicated risk and compliance committee to provide ongoing oversight of the business. By reporting directly to the CEO, the company ensures that this emphasis on measured growth originates from top-level leadership.</p>
<p><strong>Tough Decisions to Lasting Impact</strong></p>
<p>When David first arrived in Africa, the business had a broad approach of &#8220;Do everything everywhere,&#8221; which was not sustainable and would have resulted in high costs and limited returns. A tough decision was made to categorize the markets and limit local facilities management sales to five countries in Africa and the Middle East as Tier one, while the rest were placed in Tiers two and three. Initially, there was resistance due to operating in twenty-eight countries, but through continuous communication, engagement, and explanation of the thought process, the teams embraced the decision. As a result, they have enjoyed the benefits of a laser focus on sales in specific markets.</p>
<p><strong>Rave Reviews and Prestigious Awards</strong></p>
<p><em>Testimonial:</em></p>
<p>&#8220;We have worked with CBRE Excellerate Facilities Management (Pty) Ltd. for the past 5 years. They started with our stores in Zambia in 2018 and activated additional countries systematically: Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, and Nigeria. We find their expertise to be very resilient in some tough trading markets. CBRE Excellerate has been a trusted partner, and we always receive excellent service.&#8221; &#8211; Gerhard Fritz Chief Operating Officer – Non-RSA.</p>
<p><em>Awards:</em></p>
<p>As a team leader, David doesn&#8217;t prioritize individual awards. Nevertheless, he takes immense pride in his team&#8217;s achievements and accolades, considering them a true reflection of their collective efforts.</p>
<p>The CBRE Excellerate Facilities Management division was awarded the prestigious Golden Arrow Award at the PMR Africa Awards event in Johannesburg, South Africa, for the fourth consecutive year. “This remarkable achievement serves as a testament to our team&#8217;s unwavering commitment to Facilities Management excellence. It represents a collective effort that underscores our dedication to providing top-tier service to our valued customers.”</p>
<p>In recent times, the CBRE Excellerate Team achieved a significant milestone by winning the esteemed Property Service Group of the Year award 2023 at the Annual API Summit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Navigating the Numbers, Leading Mustek, and Embracing a Holistic Leadership Approach!</em></p>
<p>Every journey has a tale that just needs to be shared. How does a small-town boy from Belfast become the <strong>CEO </strong>of a leading company? What fuels the trajectory from accounting to the helm of <strong>Mustek Limited</strong>?</p>
<p>Meet <strong>Hein Engelbrecht</strong>, a name synonymous with resilience, leadership, and a journey that intertwines personal passion with professional excellence. Hailing from the chilly town of Belfast in Mpumalanga, his academic voyage led him to the University of Pretoria, where he delved into the world of accountancy. Little did he know that this would be the stepping stone to a remarkable career marked by growth and leadership.</p>
<p>The Mustek story begins with Hein&#8217;s entry as the group financial manager in 1997. The cultural fit between him and the company, combined with the potential for a fulfilling work environment, proved to be the catalyst that set his journey in motion. Rising through the ranks, he assumed the role of group financial director in 2001, followed by the position of group managing director from 2008 to 2022.</p>
<p>In 2022, an unexpected shift occurred with the passing of David Kan, leading Hein to take on the role of group CEO. His journey within Mustek has not only witnessed the company&#8217;s growth but also allowed him to contribute significantly to its evolution. From the finance department to day-to-day operations, his commitment to the company&#8217;s success has been unrelenting.</p>
<p>Beyond the boardroom, his life is a blend of professional acumen and personal passions. A sports enthusiast, he actively engages in various activities, with golf holding a special place in his heart. This holistic approach to leadership is reflected in his ability to navigate challenges with resilience, drawing inspiration not only from the corporate landscape but also from the diverse world of sports.</p>
<p><em>Below are the interview highlights:</em></p>
<p><strong>Could you please elaborate on Mustek and its inception story? </strong></p>
<p>Founded in 1987, Mustek originated in Garankuwa, just outside Pretoria. Initially, our primary focus was the supply of components to the local market. At that time, the warehouses were situated in Garankuwa, while the sales office operated from Weinberg, Sandton. As our business expanded, we introduced the Mecer brand to the market, emphasizing desktop PCs.</p>
<p>In 1996, after experiencing significant growth, we moved our operations to our current premises at 322, 15th Randjespark, Midrand. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the importance of mobile notebooks surged. While our Mecer notebook initially performed well, we faced formidable competition from larger OEM players entering the market after the lifting of sanctions. To meet this challenge, Mustek diversified its distribution business by incorporating a broader range of international brands into the local market.</p>
<p>In 1997, Mustek achieved a milestone by listing on the JSE under the ITC sector, becoming a publicly traded company. This move allowed us to showcase our performance and results to the public. From a group perspective, Rectron was established to complement Mustek&#8217;s focus on Tier 1 completed products, filling a crucial role in the component side of the business.</p>
<p>In recent years, Mustek has expanded its portfolio by investing in Mecer Inter-Ed, a training company with a specific focus on the ICT sector. Seeking to diversify revenue streams, we ventured into manufacturing, with notable investments in companies like YOA, which excels in manufacturing fiber cables in Dube Trade Port in KZN. Another strategic investment is CPS, which is dedicated to manufacturing server cabinets and related products.</p>
<p>As a testament to our growth and success, in the last financial year, Mustek reached the significant milestone of reaching the R10 billion mark. This journey reflects our commitment to adaptability, diversification, and sustained excellence in the ever-evolving technology landscape.</p>
<p><strong>How would you describe your leadership style, and what values do you prioritize in leading a team?</strong></p>
<p>Describing one&#8217;s own leadership style can be challenging, but I aim to lead from the front, unhesitant in decision-making, especially in the face of challenges. To truly understand my leadership style, it might be more insightful to inquire with the broader management team about their perspectives.</p>
<p>In alignment with Mustek&#8217;s values, I prioritize integrity, respect, and appreciation. These values are not only expectations for myself but also for my team. I foster an environment where individuals feel valued and comfortable being authentic. Given the dynamic nature of the industry, I emphasize the significance of knowledge and a positive attitude. Building robust relationships and alliances with stakeholders is a core focus, aiming for long-term benefits for all parties involved.</p>
<p>Flexibility is paramount in our ever-changing technological landscape, where innovative solutions are crucial for addressing new challenges. I advocate for a proactive approach, always seeking adaptable strategies. Ultimately, responsibility and accountability are non-negotiable. My approach revolves around making decisions with the aim of ensuring more correct decisions than incorrect ones.</p>
<p><strong>What are the key challenges you face in your industry, and how do you approach overcoming them?</strong></p>
<p>In our ever-evolving landscape, new issues, solutions, and technological shifts continuously emerge. Although artificial intelligence plays a pivotal role in various sectors, we must discern its potential impact on our business.</p>
<p>To navigate these challenges effectively, knowledge and experience are paramount. Maintaining close ties with our vendors, especially industry giants like Microsoft, Intel, Lenovo, and Huawei, provides invaluable insights. Proximity to these major players allows us to make informed decisions, anticipating potential challenges on the technological front.</p>
<p>Beyond technology, the prevailing high interest rates pose a significant challenge. As a distributor carrying stock, the associated interest costs demand careful management. Additionally, the volatility of exchange rates, especially concerning the Rand, introduces complexity. Local logistical challenges, particularly with port authorities, and the persistent issue of crime necessitate substantial investment in protecting infrastructure and inventory.</p>
<p>Having been in the industry for an extended period, we possess the advantage of recognizing trends early and proactively addressing them. While these challenges present hurdles, they also act as a protective barrier, deterring newcomers unfamiliar with the nuances of our unique trading environment.</p>
<p>As a CEO, my role involves not only spending time with industry leaders and vendors but also leveraging a team of specialists focused on specific brands. These specialists stay attuned to market dynamics, product changes, and strategic shifts. Personally, my interactions involve maintaining high-level relationships with local stakeholders, ensuring a broad understanding of our business landscape.</p>
<p>In addressing the delicate balance between innovation and stability, I acknowledge that much innovation stems from industry giants. Our role is to align ourselves strategically with their vision, target markets, and pricing strategies. While our direct impact on product innovation may be limited, but our focus lies in enhancing the overall customer experience. This involves innovations in service, support, warranties, and streamlining business processes to ensure efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>How do you balance innovation with the need for stability and consistency in your business strategies?</strong></p>
<p>I believe a critical aspect of achieving this equilibrium lies in the specialization within our team. We have specialists dedicated to specific brands, ensuring they remain well-versed in the dynamic landscape of their respective markets. Their responsibility is to stay abreast of industry changes, potential product developments, and strategic positioning for our offerings. On a personal level, my role involves maintaining high-level relationships with local stakeholders and receiving key insights from specialists without delving into technical minutiae.</p>
<p>Emphasizing strong relationships has been a cornerstone of our business, and I foresee it continuing to be integral. This collaborative approach ensures that everyone is informed not only about our initiatives and innovations but also about external factors influencing our industry. Looking forward, nurturing these relationships will remain paramount in steering our business in the right direction.</p>
<p>When addressing the question of balancing innovation with stability, our organization relies heavily on the insights provided by dedicated specialists. These individuals play a crucial role in relaying market dynamics and potential innovations, allowing us to strategically position ourselves. While significant innovation often emanates from larger industry players, our focus lies in understanding how we can align with their vision, target markets, and pricing strategies.</p>
<p>In terms of product innovation, we recognize that our primary contribution is in how we position ourselves and the additional elements surrounding our products. This encompasses aspects such as service and support, warranties, and ensuring a streamlined and efficient business process for our clients. Our innovation, therefore, revolves around enhancing the overall customer experience and addressing specific technical product needs when required.</p>
<p><strong>In your opinion, what are the most critical skills or qualities for a leader in today&#8217;s rapidly changing business landscape?</strong></p>
<p>I think you&#8217;ve got to have integrity and show respect and appreciation. You&#8217;ve got to have a certain amount of knowledge and attitude, an attitude that is quite important and flexibility. And then be responsible and accountable. If you don&#8217;t have integrity, you won&#8217;t have respect. And then your appreciation of other people will probably be very little. So, I think those are quite key for me from a leadership point of view, to make sure that people have got no doubt in those specific fundamentals.</p>
<p><strong>How do you personally invest in your continuous learning and professional development?</strong></p>
<p>So from an accounting point of view, we&#8217;re obliged to actually have continuous professional development. I won&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m where I should be, but I&#8217;m also not going to sign up on any financial statements as an auditor.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of information that&#8217;s available about the industry, new products, new lines of business, new inventions. It&#8217;s continuous learning. At the end of the day, I think and do some self-reflection and ask what have I learned today. I’ve learned to appreciate that there&#8217;s a lot of lot of knowledge within the organization. There are some clever people around. There are people who are extremely passionate about technology and where technology is going. Staff share their knowledge with me so for me that is continuous learning. On a day-to-day basis, without actually sitting down and writing an exam or some sort, I think what`s more valuable than anything else is being close enough to the action that you know what&#8217;s going on and you learn on the go. I think a key to learning is to be able to step away and let the other people go and do their magic.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond professional achievements, what personal values or experiences do you believe have contributed to your success as a CEO?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been active in sports, engaging in long-distance running, completing the Two Oceans marathon four times—an achievement I take pride in. These experiences laid the foundation for the mindset and attitude crucial in leadership. Additionally, my tennis background, playing at a competitive level on the B side and participating in Sunday afternoon matches, contributed positively to my interpersonal skills. I&#8217;ve ventured into global sports like golf and have found that my competitive nature often emerges on the golf course. I enjoy taking calculated risks and backing myself, even if I&#8217;m not the best golfer in town. Beyond sports, I value humility and authenticity, finding moments to make light of myself to bring joy to others. Coming from Belfast, I recognize the fortune of my current position and understand the fragility of success. Expressing gratitude and maintaining humility are essential to me, given the unpredictable nature of life.</p>
